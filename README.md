Run generate_friedman.ipynb to have friedman data of size 6k<br>
Then, go through the Friedman_test.ipynb 
After done the splitting, move to MASATML (takes around 10min per test )

Generate_friedman.ipynb:
Run the notebook and it can generate friedman data with 5 features and N samples.
Very simple.

Friedman_test.ipynb:
The notebook used to split data based on mahalanobis distance. It also used to visualize the final result produced by MASTML.
You can also apply on other data sets.
